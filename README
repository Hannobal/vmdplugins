------------------------------- DOCUMENTATION ---------------------------------

plugins (*.so) need to be pasted to plugins/LINUXAMD64/molfile/
in your VMD directory

dlconfigplugin:
- for DL_POLY CONFIG files
- supports velocities
- extensions: .dlcfg, .cfg, .config
- filetype "dlpolyfld" as flag and for tcl command "mol new"
- can write files from VMD

dlfieldplugin:
- for DL_POLY FIELD files
- no coordinates but bond framework, masses, charges, etc.
- molecule name becomes resname (only first eight characters)
- number of molecule type becomes segid (starts with 0)
- resid is a unique molecule ID
- atomic number, element and radius are guessed from mass
- extensions: .dlcfg, .cfg, .config
- filetype "dlpolycfg" as flag and for tcl command "mol new" 

lammpsdataplugin:
- for LAMMPS data files
- supports velocities
- supports CGCMM stype:
  - activate by keyword "CGCMM" anywhere in the header line (case sensitive)
  - residue name and atom name appended to atoms. Example:
    1      1      1 -1.200  2.05  3.23 -4.33 # H12 ALA
  - atom types appended to masses. Example:
    1      12.0100 # CA
- atoms are renumbered if they are not continuousily numbered 1..N
  but the order of their IDs is preserved
- atomic number, element and radius are guessed from mass
- extensions: .dlfld, .field
- filetype "lammpsdata" as flag and for tcl command "mol new"

#### change notes:
2017-12-08
switched resid and segid for dlfieldplugin, as more than 32768 different
segids or resnames cause an overflow error.
